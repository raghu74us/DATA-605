# Introduction: 

  Below is the dataset of house prices available from Kaggle.com. The dataset has 1460 observations of houses in Ames, Iowa, and 81 variables potentially contributing to the house sale price.

```{r a1}

library(knitr)
library(DT)
library(MASS)
library(reshape)
library(ggplot2)

traindf <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raghu74us/DATA-605/master/Final%20Project/train.csv')
  
datatable(traindf, options = list( pageLength = 5, lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 40),   initComplete = JS(
    "function(settings, json) {",
    "$(this.api().table().header()).css({'background-color': '#01975b', 'color': '#fff'});",
    "}")), rownames=TRUE)

```


# Variables

  Pick one of the quantitative independent variables from the training data set (train.csv) , and define that variable as  X.   Pick SalePrice as the dependent variable, and define it as Y for the next analysis.   
  
```{r v1}
#chosen variable
X<-traindf$OverallCond
Y<-traindf$SalePrice

plot(X,Y, col="#4caf50", main="Scatterplot of Overall Condition and Sale Price", xlab = "Overall Condition", ylab="Sale Price")
abline(lm(Y~X), col="yellow", lwd=3) # regression line (y~x) 

hist(X, col="green", main="Histogram of Overall Condition", xlab = "Overall Condition")

hist(Y, col="#80cbc4", main="Histogram of Sale Price", xlab = "Sale Price")

print("Summary of X variable: Overall Condition")
summary(X)
boxplot(X)
print("Summary of X variable: Sale Price")
summary(Y)
boxplot(Y)

```



# Probability

  Calculate as a minimum the below probabilities a through c.  Assume the small letter "x" is estimated as the 1st quartile of the X variable, and the small letter "y" is estimated as the 2nd quartile of the Y variable.  Interpret the meaning of all probabilities.  

a.	$$ P(X>x | Y>y) $$		

  
```{r P1}

XQ1<-quantile(X, probs=0.25)  #1st quartile of X variable
XQ1
YQ2<-quantile(Y, probs=0.50) #2nd quartile, or median, of Y variable
YQ2
n<-(nrow(traindf))
n
overallcond<-as.numeric(traindf$OverallCond)
saleprice<-as.numeric(traindf$SalePrice)

nYQ2<-nrow(subset(traindf,saleprice>YQ2))
nYQ2
p1<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond > XQ1 & saleprice>YQ2))/nYQ2
p1

```

b.  $$ P(X>x \& Y>y)	$$	

```{r P2}

p2<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond > XQ1 & saleprice>YQ2))/n
p2

```

c.  $$ P(X<x | Y>y) $$		

```{r P3}

p3<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond < XQ1 & saleprice>YQ2))/nYQ2
p3

```


# Independence

   Does splitting the training data in this fashion make them independent? In other words, does P(XY)=P(X)P(Y))?   Check mathematically, and then evaluate by running a Chi Square test for association. You might have to research this.  


```{r P4}

c1<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond <=XQ1 & saleprice<=YQ2))/n
c2<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond <=XQ1 & saleprice>YQ2))/n
c4<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond >XQ1 & saleprice<=YQ2))/n
c5<-nrow(subset(traindf, overallcond >XQ1 & saleprice>YQ2))/n

dfcounts<-matrix(round(c(c1,c2,c4,c5),3), ncol=2, nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(dfcounts)<-c(
"<=1 quartile",
">1 quartile")
rownames(dfcounts)<-c("<=2nd quartile",">2nd quartile")

print("Quartile Matrix Percent")

dfcounts<-as.table(dfcounts)
addmargins(dfcounts)

print (paste0("p(A)*p(B)=", round(c4*c5,5)))


```



$$ p(AB)=p(X>x \& Y>y)= 0.24313$$

$$ p(A)*p(B)=0.03106 $$  
$$ p(AB) != p(A)*p(B)$$

```{r P4.1}

chisq.test(dfcounts, correct=TRUE) 

```


# Statistics

   Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. Provide univariate descriptive statistics and appropriate plots for both variables.   Provide a scatterplot of X and Y.  Transform both variables simultaneously using Box-Cox transformations.  You might have to research this.


```{r P5}

summary(traindf)

```


## Confidence interval

```{r P6}

t.test(traindf$OverallCond, traindf$SalePrice)

```

# Linear Algebra and Correlation.   

Using at least three untransformed variables, build a correlation matrix.  Invert your correlation matrix. (This is known as the precision matrix and contains variance inflation factors on the diagonal.) Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix, and then multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix.

```{r P7}

myvars<-data.frame(traindf$OverallCond, traindf$YearBuilt,traindf$SalePrice)
head(myvars) 
cor(myvars)

cor.test(traindf$OverallCond + traindf$YearBuilt, traindf$SalePrice, conf.level = 0.99)

t.test(traindf$OverallCond + traindf$YearBuilt, traindf$SalePrice, conf.level = 0.99)

mymx<-as.matrix(cor(myvars))
#correlation matrix
mymx


#inverse of correlation matrix, precision matrix
ginvmymx<-ginv(mymx)
ginvmymx


#corr mat * precision mat
mymxginv<-mymx%*%ginvmymx
round(mymxginv,2)

#precision mat x corr mat
ginvmymx<-ginvmymx%*%mymx
round(ginvmymx,2)


```


With a 99 percent confidence level, the correlation between Overall condition plus Year Built and Sale Price is estimated to be between 0.47 and 0.57.



## Principal Components Analysis

### correlation matrix for all quantitative variables

```{r P8}

#Correlation matrix of all quantitative variables in dataframe

cormatrix<-cor(traindf[,sapply(traindf, is.numeric)])
cordf<-as.data.frame(cormatrix)
kable(head(cordf))


```



###correlation

```{r P8.1}

cordf[cordf == 1] <- NA #drop correlation of 1, diagonals
cordf[abs(cordf) < 0.1] <- NA # drop correlations of less than 0.1
cordf<-as.matrix(cordf)
#cordf
cordf2<- na.omit(melt(cordf)) 
kable(head(cordf2[order(-abs(cordf2$value)),]))

```

### All variables with correlation to Sale Price
```{r P8.2}
#test of alternate corr approach
#myvars<-data.frame(traindf$OverallCond, traindf$SalePrice)
#head(myvars)

topcors <- cordf2[ which(cordf2$X2=='SalePrice'),]

topcorsdf<-topcors[order(-abs(topcors$value)),]# sort by highest correlations
#topcorsdf

cors1<-data.frame(topcorsdf$X1,topcorsdf$X2,topcorsdf$value)
kable(cors1)

par(mar=c(8,8,1,1))
barplot(topcorsdf$value, ylab="Correlation to Sale Price", ylim=c(0,1), col=rainbow(20), las=2, names.arg=topcorsdf$X1)



```


# Sampling

  Calculus-Based Probability & Statistics.  Many times, it makes sense to fit a closed form distribution to data.  For your non-transformed independent variable, location shift (if necessary)  it so that the minimum value is above zero.  Then load the MASS package and run fitdistr to fit a density function of your choice.  (See  https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/fitdistr.html ).  Find the optimal value of the parameters for this distribution, and then take 1000 samples from this distribution (e.g., rexp(1000, ???) for an exponential).  Plot a histogram and compare it with a histogram of your non-transformed original variable.   
  
Minimum value is above 0.

```{r P9}

#check that min val is not 0
min(traindf$OverallCond)

```  


```{r P9.1}

fit <- fitdistr(traindf$OverallCond, "exponential")
lambda <- fit$estimate
sampledf <- rexp(1000, lambda)
lambda
sampledf<-data.frame(as.numeric(sampledf))
colnames(sampledf)[1] <- "sample"
str(sampledf)
head(sampledf)
hist(sampledf$sample, col="green", main="Histogram of Exponential Distribution", xlab = "Overall Condition", breaks=30)
```

## Multiple Linear Regression

```{r P10}

fit <- lm(traindf$SalePrice ~ traindf$OverallQual + traindf$GrLivArea + traindf$GarageCars + traindf$GarageArea, data=traindf)
summary(fit)

```




$$ SalePrice=26988.854*OverallQual + 49.573*GrLivArea + 11317.522*GarageCars + 41.478*GarageArea - 98436.050 $$

```{r P11}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
X1<-traindf$OverallQual
X2<-traindf$GrLivArea
X3<-traindf$GarageCars
X4<-traindf$GarageArea
Y<-traindf$SalePrice

plot(X1,Y, col="#f06293", main="OverallQual", ylab="Sale Price")
abline(lm(Y~X1), col="green", lwd=3) # regression line (y~x)

plot(X2,Y, col="#9c27b1", main="GrLivArea", ylab="Sale Price")
abline(lm(Y~X2), col="green", lwd=3) # regression line (y~x)

plot(X3,Y, col="#ce93d7", main="GarageCars", ylab="Sale Price")
abline(lm(Y~X3), col="green", lwd=3) # regression line (y~x)

plot(X4,Y, col="#c2185c", main="GarageArea", ylab="Sale Price")
abline(lm(Y~X4), col="green", lwd=3) # regression line (y~x)

```


  Load test data set and create calculated column using equation for multiple linear regression. Select required columns and export to csv for contest entry.

```{r P12}
dftest <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raghu74us/DATA-605/master/Final%20Project/test.csv')

SalePrice<-((26988.854*dftest$OverallQual) + (49.573*dftest$GrLivArea) +  (11317.522*dftest$GarageCars) + (41.478*dftest$GarageArea) -98436.050)


dftest<-dftest[,c("Id","OverallQual","GrLivArea","GarageCars","GarageArea")]

kable(head(dftest))

submission <- cbind(dftest$Id,SalePrice)
colnames(submission)[1] <- "Id"
submission[submission<0] <- median(SalePrice)
submission<-as.data.frame(submission[1:1459,])
submission[is.na(submission)] <- 0
head(submission)

```

# Analysis:   

    Based on the correlation of attributes and sale price, I chose the top four attributes with high correlation. I also used only the linear regression modal to predict the score. With this modal and parameter, I got a kaggle score of 0.78.  Residuals is high based on the linear modal regression. For these 4 attributes, scatter plot shows its linear and normally distributed. Inititally i did a comparison of "overall condition" and Saleprice but the "Overall Condition" did not show up in the correlation. The probability test proves P(A???B) <> P(A)P(B) that the variables are dependent.  The correlation test of OverallCond + Yearbuilt vs Saleprice gave a confidence interval of 0.47 and 0.57. 
    Inorder to improve the score, I would have to try with different regression modals and also the top 10 attributes with high correlation.
